# Parking Management System

## Overview
The **Parking Management System** is a computer vision project designed to monitor and manage parking spaces in real-time. Using YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for image processing, the system can detect parking occupancy, update parking status dynamically, and display information on available and occupied spots.

## Features
- **Real-Time Parking Spot Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting vehicles in predefined parking spots.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Displays the video stream with parking spots highlighted as occupied or available.
- **Data Storage**: Saves parking status on user command for later analysis.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to multiple video feeds, suitable for large parking facilities.

## Installation
To set up the Parking Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Parking-Management-System
